## :goal_net: Goals

This sample achieves the following goals:

* Demonstrate how to implement 12-factor cloud-native applications in ASP.NET Core 6.
* Demonstrate how to integrate microservices with a data mesh/data platform.
* Demonstrate how to implement end-to-end ML solutions with MLOps.

## :triangular_flag_on_post: Status

This sample is a work in progress and by no means complete. Currently, only the
microservices are available in the solution. Also, not all planned functionality
is in the microservices yet.

Please note, the solution was previously called recommend-coffee. We're renaming it to tasty beans.
You may or may not find a lot of references to the old solution name :smile:

All features are subject to change. But that's part of the fun :grin:

## :computer: System requirements

Please make sure you have the following tools available:

* [Helm 3](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/)
* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)
* [Powershell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell)
* [Istio](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/getting-started/)
* [Dapr](https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/install-dapr-cli/)

You'll need 2 CPU cores available and 16GB of memory for all the containers in
the solution. You can deploy with less, but it's untested, so you've been warned.

Make sure you have `istio`, `helm`, and `kubectl` in your `PATH` variable. The
utility scripts expect you to have these tools available.
