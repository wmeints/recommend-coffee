# Recommend-coffee

Welcome to the recommend-coffee sample repository. In this repository we've stored a sample solution that demonstrates
how to combine micro services with a data mesh architecture.

## Getting started

We've made two kinds of deployment scenarios for the sample solution. You can run everything on your local machine
using docker-compose or you can deploy the solution to Kubernetes. We recommend using Kubernetes as not every laptop
or desktop machine will have enough memory to run everything.

* [Running the solution using Docker Compose](docs/deployment/01-docker-compose.md)
* [Running the solution using Kubernetes](docs/deployment/02-kubernetes.md)

## Documentation

You can learn more about the structure of the sample solution and how the recommend-coffee business works in
[the documentation](docs/01-introduction.md).

## Contributing

Feel free to submit issues for things that don't work or improvements you'd like to see.
You can also let us know if you're using this sample solution at your company.
We'd love to hear how you're using the sample solution!
